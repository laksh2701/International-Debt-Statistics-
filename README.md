# International-Debt-Statistics


# Project Overview:

The International Debt Analysis project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the debt dynamics, trends, and implications on a global scale. It involves studying the debt positions of different countries, examining their borrowing and repayment patterns, and assessing the economic and financial impact of international debt.

# Model Performance-
* The graph compares the performance of different models based on evaluation metrics Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared scores. 
* The Random Forest model shows the lowest MSE and MAE values, indicating better accuracy and precision in predicting the target variable, with an R-squared score of 0.95 demonstrating a strong correlation between the predicted and actual value, hence it is the better fit model.


# Challenges faced- 
* Evaluating different regression algorithms and overcoming challenges in gridsearchCV to finely tune hyperparameters for improved model performance.
* Employing techniques like Cross Validation and extra tree regressor to uncover influential features that play a crucial role in shaping the model's predictions.


# Learning- 
* We got better at using regression tools, tweaking settings, and finding important features by taking help of online resources.
